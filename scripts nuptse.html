  <div class="header">EXT. LONDON SCHOOLYARD - DAY</div>
	 
  <div class="action">The scene unfolds against the backdrop of London, brick houses lining the streets. Our BOY strolls down the lane, different – no Nuptse, no swagger. Just an invitation for aggro.  As he approaches the schoolyard, he walks past a group of student outside the schoolyard, each sporting a Nuptse like an armor.
Their HEAD HONCHO, spotting our BOY, narrows his eyes and yells.</div>
   
  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>Oi, mate. You lost? Dressed like that, you're a right walking target bro. Where's your protection?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">BOY WITHOUT JACKET</p>
    <p>Protection against the cold? It's just a bit of chill, innit?</p>
  </div>

   <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>No, fam! It ain't about the frost; it's the wolves you gotta watch, the bullies! You’re wearing an invitation to an ass-kicking going to school looking like that.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">The HEAD HONCHO pauses, taking a deep breath as he surveys the schoolyard, he rubs the back of his neck, a gesture of annoyance then locks eyes with our boy.</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO (CONT'D)</p>
    <p>Ah man, I don't know why I'm doing this, but imma help you out, bro. At this exact moment, you’re a bully’s wet dream. Imagine if a bully sees you without a Nuptse...Look.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">CUT TO:</div>
  
  <div class="action">A  Guy Ritchie-style montage, the camera whipping between subjects  Quick cuts and slick transitions parade the Nuptse jacket in all its glory as the honcho continues.</div>
  
  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO (V.O. OUT OF FRAME)</p>
    <p>Guy with Nuptse Jacket, guy with Nuptse Jacket, guy without, guy with Nuptse... </p>
  </div>
	
	<div class="action">Celebrating the diversity in style only possible with a nupts the camera captures a TEENAGER in a Nuptse, brimming with confidence as he strides across the frame. Another leans casually against a wall, his glasses catching the light. Then a group, all in Nuptse jackets. Suddenly, the frame rests on a lone figure,  without a Nuptse, a stark contrast to the rest. Lastly a student decked in nuptse but mountain gear styled. As the montage concludes, we return to the group</div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO (CONT'D)</p>
    <p>Who do you think he’s going to bully?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">BOY</p>
    <p>The guy with glasses? Ehh.. Mountain-climber-guy? That seems like an odd identity, worthy of bullying, no?</p>
  </div>

  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>Let me provide you insight into the mindset of a bully, bro; a bloke with glasses will always have glasses. But you, on the other hand, might not wear that outfit again. And mountain-guy is the goat, that’s a vintage Nuptse, bro.</p>
  </div>

	<div class="action">The BOY, now aware of the stakes, feels the weight of his vulnerability. Sensing his nervousness the Honcho responds with a hint satisfaction in his voice</div>
  <div class="dialogue">
    <p class="character">HEAD HONCHO</p>
    <p>Don’t worry bro. I got your back.</p>
  </div>

  <div class="action">In a gesture of solidarity, the HEAD HONCHO throws the BOY a Nuptse jacket in its iconic pocketed form. Now united by Nuptsies the group enters the schoolyard, ready to face whatever comes their way.</div>
